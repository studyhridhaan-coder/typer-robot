A robo with a hardware similar to 3d printer except that has pen and not filament and same plotter mechanism to help me write low-value tasks like onpaper applications and other documents and save my precious time

(P.s I am using arduino as i have that aldready)

The problem:
I have to spend a lot of time doing low value task like writing handmade applications for school, making a card or maybe writing notes 

The Solution:
I really wanna make a cool plotter that will write for me (very close to a human style)!!
